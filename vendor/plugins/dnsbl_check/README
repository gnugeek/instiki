This plugin checks if the client is listed in RBLs (Real-time Blackhole Lists).
These are lists of IP addresses misbehaving. There are many RBLs, some are more
aggressive than others. More information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL

This filter will result in one DNS request for every blocklist that you have
configured. This might be problematic for sites under heavy load, although this
plugin has been used on high-traffic sites without any problem. One DNS
request takes a few miliseconds to complete, after all.
