 * trunk:
         Fixed --daemon option.
         
 * 0.10.2:
          Upgraded to Rails 0.13.1
          Fixed HTML export
          Added layout=no option to the export_html action (it exports page contents processed 
          by the markup engine, but without the default layout - so that they can be wrapped in 
          some other layout)
          <nowiki> tag can span several lines (before it was applied when both opening and closing 
          tags were on the same line only)
          Resolved the "endless redirection loop" condition and otherwise improved handling of 
          errors in the rendering engines
          Fixed rendering of Markdown hyperlinks such as [Text](http://something.com/foo)

 * 0.10.1:
          Upgraded Rails to 0.12.0
          Upgraded rubyzip to version 0.5.8
          BlueCloth is back (RedCloth didn't do pure Markdown well enough)
          Handling of line breaks in Textile is as in 0.9 (inserts <br/> tag)
          Fixed HTML export (to enclose the output in <html> tags, include the stylesheet etc)
          Corrected some compatibility issues with storages from earlier Instiki versions
          Some other bug fixes

 * 0.10.0:
          Ported to ActionPack
          RedCloth 3.0.3
          BlueCloth is phased out, Markdown is rendered by RedCloth
          Mix markup option understands both Textile and Markdown on the same page
          Instiki can serve static content (such as HTML or plain-text files) from ./public 
          directory
          Much friendlier admin interface
          Wiki link syntax doesn't conflict with Textile hyperlink syntax. Therefore
          "textile link":LinkToSomePlace will not look insane.
          RSS feeds accept query parameters, sush as 
          http://localhost:2500/wiki/rss_with_headlines?start=2005-02-18&end=2005-02-19&limit=10
          RSS feed with page contents for a password-protected web behaves as follows:
            if the web is published, RSS feed links to the published version of the web
            otherwise, the feed is not available
          Madeleine will check every hour if there are new commands in the log or 24 hours have 
          passed since last snapshot, and take snapshot if either of these conditions is true
          Madeleine will also not log read-only operations, resulting in a better performance
          Wiki extracts (to HTML and plain text) will leave only the last extract file in ./storage
          Wiki search handles multibyte (UTF-8) characters correctly
          Local hyperlinks in published pages point to published pages [Michael DeHaan]
          Fixed a bug that sometimes caused all past revisions of a page to be "forgotten" on 
          restart
          Fixed parsing of URIs with a port number (http://someplace.org:8080)
          Instiki will not fork itself on a *nix, unless explicitly asked to
          Instiki can bind to IPs other than 127.0.0.1 (command-line option)
          Revisions that do not change anything on the page are rejected
          Automated tests for all controller actions
          category: lines are presented as links to "All Pages" for relevant categories
          Search looks at page titles, as well as content
          Multiple other usability enhancements and bug fixes

 * 0.9.2:
          Rollback takes the user to an edit form. The form has to be submitted for the change to 
          take place.
          Changed to use inline style on published pages
          Fixed "forward in time" on the last revision before current page
          Instiki won't log bogus error messages when creating a new Wiki
          Fixed deprecation warning for Object.id (introduced in Ruby 1.8.2)

          Fixed IP logging and RSS feeds behind proxies [With help from Guan Yang]
          Fixed default storage directory (borked running on Windows) [Spotted by Curt Hibbs]

          Added aliased links such as [[HomePage|that nice home page]] [Mark Reid]
          Added include other page content with [[!include TableOfContents]] [Mark Reid]
          Added delete orphan pages from the Edit Web screen [by inspiration from Simon Arnaud]
          Added logging of IP address for authors (who's behind the rollback wars)
          Added Categories pages through backlinks (use "categories: news, instiki" on start of line) [Mark Reid]

          Added command-line option to specify different storage path
          Added print view without navigation

          Fixed performance problems for All Pages list [Dennis Mertz]
          Fixed lots of rendering bugs [Mark Reid]
          Upgraded to RedCloth 2.0.11 [integrating the fine work of Dennis Mertz]
          
 * 0.8.9:
          Added color diffs to see changes between revisions [Bill Atkins]
              They're aren't quite perfect yet as new paragraphs split the <ins> tags (hence 0.8.9, not 0.9.0)
          Added redirect to edit if content of page generates an error
              (so the page doesn't become unusable on bugs in the markup engines)
          Fixed update Web with different address bug [Denis Metz]
          Fixed a bunch of wiki word rendering issues by doing wiki word detection and replacment at once
          Upgraded to BlueCloth 0.0.3b (should fix loads of problems on Markdown wikis)
          
 * 0.8.5:
          Instiki can now serve as a CMS by running a password-protected web with a published front
          Added version check at startup (Instiki needs Ruby 1.8.1)

          Actually included RedCloth 2.0.7 in the release

          Accepts wiki words in bracket style. Ex: [[wiki word]], [[c]],  [[We could'nt have done it!]]
          Accepts camel-case wiki words in all latin, greek, cyrillian, and armenian unicode characters
             Many thanks to Guan Yang for building the higher- and lower-case lookup tables
             And thanks to Simon Arnaud for the initial patch that got the work started
          Changed charset to UTF-8

          Authors are no longer listed under orphan pages
          Added export to markup (great for backups, potentially for switching wiki engine)
          Don't link wiki words that proceeds from either /, = or ?
            (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiClones, /show/HomePage, cgi.pl?show=WikiWord without escaping)
          Accessing an unexisting page redirects to a different url (/new/PageName)
          Increased snapshot time to just once a day (cuts down on disk storage requirements)
          Made RDoc support work better with 1.8.1 [Mauricio Fern‡ndez]
          Added convinient redirect from /wiki/ to /wiki/show/HomePage

          Added wanted and orphan page lists to All pages (only show up if there's actually orphan or wanted pages)
          Added ISO-8859-1 as XML encoding in RSS feeds (makes FeedReader among others happy for special entities)
          Added proper links in the RSS feed (but the body links are still relative, which NNW and others doesn't grok)
          Added access keys: E => Edit, H => HomePage, A => All Pages, U => Recently Revised, X => Export

          Polished authors and recently revised 
          Updated to RedCloth 2.0.6

          Changed searching to be case insensitive
          Changed HomePage to display the name of the web instead
          Changed exported HTML pages to be valid XHTML (which can be preprocessed by XSLT)
          Fixed broken recently revised
