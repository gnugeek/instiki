===What is Instiki?

Admitted, it's YetAnotherWikiClone[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiClones], but with a strong focus
on simplicity of installation and running:

Step 1. Download
Step 2. Run "instiki"

If you are on Windows:
"Step 3. Chuckle... "There's no step three!" (TM)"

You're now running a perfectly suitable wiki on port 2500 
that'll present you with one-step setup, followed by a textarea for the home page
on http://localhost:2500

Instiki lowers the barriers of interest for when you might consider
using a wiki. It's so simple to get running that you'll find yourself
using it for anything -- taking notes, brainstorming, organizing a 
gathering.

Having said all that, if you are not on Windows, in this version of Instiki it is a somewhat different story.
Since the author has no Linux or Mac at hand, and Instiki is moving to a SQL-based backend, this is what it takes 
to install (until somebody sends a patch to properly package Instiki for all those other platforms):

3. Kill "instiki"
4. Install SQLite 3 database engine from http://www.sqlite.org/
5. Install SQLite 3 driver for Ruby from http://sqlite-ruby.rubyforge.org/
6. Install Rake from http://rake.rubyforge.org/
7. Execute rm -f db/*.db
8. Execute 'rake migrate'
9. Make an embarrassed sigh (as I do while writing this)
10. Run 'instiki' again
11. Pat yourself on the shoulder for being such a talented geek
12. At least, there is no step twelve! (TM)

===Features:
* Regular expression search: Find deep stuff really fast
* Revisions: Follow the changes on every page from birth. Rollback to an earlier rev
* Export to HTML or markup in a zip: Take the entire wiki with you home or for reference
* RSS feeds to track recently revised pages
* Multiple webs: Create separate wikis with their own namespace
* Password-protected webs: Keep it private
* Authors: Each revision is associated with an author, so you can see who changed what
* Reference tracker: Which other pages are pointing to the current?
* Speed: Using Madelein[http://madeleine.sourceforge.net] for persistence (all pages are in memory)
* Three markup choices: Textile[http://www.textism.com/tools/textile] 
  (default / RedCloth[http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth]), 
  Markdown (BlueCloth[http://bluecloth.rubyforge.org]), and RDoc[http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc]
* Embedded webserver: Through WEBrick[http://www.webrick.org]
* Internationalization: Wiki words in any latin, greek, cyrillian, or armenian characters
* Color diffs: Track changes through revisions
* Definitely can run on SQLite and MySQL
* May be able to run on Postgres, Oracle, DB2 and SqlServer (if you try this )

===Command-line options:
* Run "ruby instiki --help"

===History:
 * See CHANGELOG

===Migrating Instiki 0.10.2 storage to Instiki 0.11.0 database
1. Install Instiki 0.11 and check that it works (you should be able to create a web, edit and save a HomePage)
2. Execute 
      ruby script\import_storage \
          -t /full/path/to/instiki0.10/storage \
          -i /full/path/to/instiki0.10/installation \
          -d sqlite (or mysql, or postgres, depending on what you use) \
          -o instiki_import.sql
   for example (Windows):
   ruby script\import_storage -t c:\instiki-0.10.2\storage\2500 -i c:\instiki-0.10.2 -d sqlite -o instiki_import.sql
3. This will produce instiki_import.sql file in the current working directory. 
   Open it in a text editor and inspect carefully.
4. Connect to your production database (e.g., 'sqlite3 db\prod.db'), 
   and have it execute instiki_import.sql (e.g., '.read instiki_import.sql')
5. Execute ruby script\reset_references 
   (this script parses all pages for crosslinks between them, so it may take a few minutes)
6. Restart Instiki
7. Go over some pages, especially those with a lot of complex markup, and see if anything is broken.

The most common migration problem is this: if you open All Pages and see a lot of orphaned pages, 
you forgot to run ruby script\reset_references after importing the data.

===Upgrading from Instiki-AR Beta 1
In Beta 2, we switch to ActiveRecord:Migrations. Therefore:
1. Back up your production database.
2. Open command-line session to your database and execute: 
  create table schema_info (version integer(11)); 
  insert into schema_info (version) values (1);
3. Go back to the shell, change directory to the new Instiki and execute "rake migrate".

Step 2 creates a table that tells to ActiveRecord:Migrations that the current version 
of this database is 1 (corresponding to Beta 1), and step 3 makes it up-to-date with
the current version of Instiki.
