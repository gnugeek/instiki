===What is Instiki?

Admitted, it's YetAnotherWikiClone[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiClones], but with a strong focus
on simplicity of installation and running:

Step 1. Download

Step 2. Run "instiki"

Step 3. Chuckle... "There's no step three!" (TM)

You're now running a perfectly suitable wiki on port 2500 
that'll present you with one-step setup, followed by a textarea for the home page
on http://localhost:2500.

Instiki lowers the barriers of interest for when you might consider
using a wiki. It's so simple to get running that you'll find yourself
using it for anything -- taking notes, brainstorming, organizing a 
gathering.

===Features:
* Regular expression search: Find deep stuff really fast
* Revisions: Follow the changes on every page from birth. Rollback to an earlier rev
* Export to HTML or markup in a zip: Take the entire wiki with you home or for reference
* RSS feeds to track recently revised pages
* Multiple webs: Create separate wikis with their own namespace
* Password-protected webs: Keep it private
* Authors: Each revision is associated with an author, so you can see who changed what
* Reference tracker: Which other pages are pointing to the current?
* Speed: Using Madelein[http://madeleine.sourceforge.net] for persistence (all pages are in memory)
* Three markup choices: Textile[http://www.textism.com/tools/textile] 
  (default / RedCloth[http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth]), 
  Markdown (BlueCloth[http://bluecloth.rubyforge.org]), and RDoc[http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc]
* Embedded webserver: Through WEBrick[http://www.webrick.org]
* Internationalization: Wiki words in any latin, greek, cyrillian, or armenian characters
* Color diffs: Track changes through revisions

===Missing:
* File attachments

===Install from gem:
* Install rubygems
* Run "gem install instiki"
* Change to a directory where you want Instiki to keep its data files (for example,  ~/instiki/)
* Run "instiki" - this will create a "storage" directory (for example, ~/instiki/storage), and start a new Wiki service

Make sure that you always launch Instiki from the same working directory, or specify the storage directory in runtime parameters, such as:
  instiki --storage ~/instiki/storage

===Command-line options:
* Run "instiki --help"

===History:
 * See CHANGELOG

===Download latest from: 
* http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=186

===Visit the official Instiki wiki:
* http://www.instiki.org

===License:
* same as Ruby's
